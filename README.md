# AutoTL
Another starter project to use more of the EasyOCR features, as well as image preprocessing. Focusing on using more of the whole image and tuning the pre-processing to make text stand out.
AutoTL aims to upload/import raw, untranslated manga and create a new image with the translation overlayed. 
Need to import the jpn_ver5.traineeddata into tessdata folder for trained data
